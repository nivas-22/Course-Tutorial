Identity and Access Management (IAM) is at the heart of cybersecurity controlling who gets access to what, and when.

Most people know the term, but only a few truly understand its inner workings.

Everyone in tech knows IAM.
But not everyone speaks IAM.

Here are acronyms that separate beginners from experts 👇

🔐 IAM – Identity & Access Management: who can access what.

⏱ JIT – Just-In-Time Provisioning: give access only when it’s needed, then remove it.

🔄 SCIM – System for Cross-domain Identity Management: automate how user accounts are created, updated, or removed across systems.

🆔 SSO – Single Sign-On: one login for all your apps.

🔑 MFA – Multi-Factor Authentication: prove who you are with more than one factor (like password + phone).

💼 RBAC – Role-Based Access Control: access based on job role.

📊 ABAC – Attribute-Based Access Control: access based on user or resource attributes (e.g., location, time).

📜 PBAC – Policy-Based Access Control: define flexible access rules through policies.

👑 PAM – Privileged Access Management: protect admin and high-level accounts.

⚖️ IGA – Identity Governance & Administration: manage the full identity lifecycle and ensure compliance.

📱 FIDO2 – Passwordless Authentication Standard: secure login using biometrics or security keys.

🧩 OIDC – OpenID Connect: standard that makes SSO possible across modern web apps.

🛠 SAML – Security Assertion Markup Language: an older but still common standard for SSO.

📬 LDAP – Lightweight Directory Access Protocol: how apps talk to directories like Active Directory.

🕵️ SoD – Segregation of Duties: make sure no single person can perform risky combinations of actions.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the foundation of secure digital systems but it comes with its own language. 

Knowing key IAM acronyms like MFA, SSO, RBAC, and PAM helps you understand how organizations manage who gets access, when, and why.
